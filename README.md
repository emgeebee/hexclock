# hexclock

A small project to help me learn alt.js and react.

## Features

1. Shows the time using colours!
2. Divides the day into 3 overlapping 12 hour blocks, and during each "third" oscillates the relevant rgb value. i.e. between midnight and midday, red is osciallting. 6am to 6pm is blue and midday to midnight is green
3. Also updates the favicon!
4. As the seconds in a minute update the clock on the page beomes more opaque.

##todo

1. config - which colour comes first...
